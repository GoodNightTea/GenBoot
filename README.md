# GenOS - Simple 32-bit Operating System

This is a minimalist bootloader and kernel system built as a graduation project. This includes my experience creating bootloaders, protected mode transitions, interrupt handling, and VGA text display.

**Note:** This will not be the next ubuntu, I just want to learn how to build OS from scratch in x86 asm!

## Features

- Multi-stage bootloader (16-bit â†’ 32-bit transition)
- 32-bit protected mode kernel
- Interrupt handling with PIC initialization  
- VGA text mode display with colors
- Modular architecture using NASM includes
- Custom file system (GenFS v2)

## Architecture

- **Stage 1**: 16-bit BIOS bootloader, handles disk I/O
- **Stage 2**: Protected mode transition and kernel loading
- **Kernel**: 32-bit kernel with VGA and interrupt subsystems
- **VGA Driver**: Parameter-based display functions

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
- NASM assembler
- Python 3
- QEMU (for testing)

### Compilation

## Compile bootloader
nasm -f bin boot.asm -o build/boot.bin

## Compile Stage 2  
nasm -f bin stage2.asm -o build/stage2.bin

## Compile kernel (with includes)
nasm -f bin -I kernel/ kernel/main_kernel.asm -o build/kernel.bin

## Create disk image using GenFS
python3 tools/genfs_v2_builder.py build/boot.bin build/images/genos.img build/stage2.bin build/kernel.bin

## Test with QEMU
qemu-system-x86_64 -drive file=build/images/genos.img,format=raw,if=floppy
